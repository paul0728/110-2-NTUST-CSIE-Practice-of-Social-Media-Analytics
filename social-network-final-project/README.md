# Facebook link prediction

This project explores link prediction, which involves predicting the existence of connections between entities in a network. Our focus is on the Facebook public pages dataset, using features such as shortest path length, Jaccard distance, and node embeddings like [GEMSEC](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/GEMSEC) and DeepWalk. We compare the performance of two machine learning models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, for link prediction tasks. The results provide insights into feature importance and the effectiveness of different embedding methods for community detection and prediction accuracy.
